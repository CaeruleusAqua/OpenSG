OpenSG Simple Examples
======================

This directory has some relatively simple examples of how to use OpenSG. Some
even demonstrate the use of more advanced features like the cluster support.

To build the programs you need scons which you can download (www.scons.org) or
(if you have a complete OpenSG source tree) use the version
Tools/scons-local/scons.py.  In order to find the OpenSG libraries the
included SConstruct file looks for the osg2-config tool that is normally
installed with OpenSG. If osg2-config is not found by scons, you can pass the
OpenSG2BaseDir=/path/to/OpenSG2/install/location command line argument when
invoking scons. This path should point to a directory that has a
bin/osg2-config below it.

The first few of the examples here are numbered and are moving from the very
simple slowly to more advanced topics. If you are new to OpenSG you might want
to follow these examples in order, or perhaps better yet, check out the
contents of Examples/Tutorial (and the README there) where the code is
accompanied by an introductory text on the online wiki.
The un-numbered programs each demonstrate a specific feature and have generally
no specific order in which they should be studied.

A number of the examples can load models from disc by passing a file name as
argument on the command line. If you don't have a suitable model, you can find
some in Examples/Tutorial/Data (look for .wrl files).

For questions, ideas or contributions you can contact the opensg-users mailing
list opensg-users@lists.sourceforge.net.
