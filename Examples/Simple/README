OpenSG Simple Examples
======================

This directory has some relatively simple examples of how to use OpenSG. Some
also demonstrate the use of more advanced features like the cluster support.

To build the programs you need CMake (www.cmake.org). If you are building
OpenSG from source you can just pass -DOSGBUILD_EXAMPLES_SIMPLE=ON on the
cmake command line and the examples will be built together with the libraries.
If you want to build the examples standalone (that is against an installed
version of OpenSG) do the following:

- create a build directory
- run cmake in the build directory passing the following:
      -DOPENSG_ROOT=/path/to/installed/OpenSG
      -DBOOST_ROOT=/path/to/boost             (optional, attempts to find the system boost)
      -DCOLLARA_ROOT_DIR=/path/to/colladadom  (if OpenSG was built with collada support)
      /path/to/Examples/Simple
- run make or build using the generated project files

The first few of the examples here are numbered and are moving from the very
simple slowly to more advanced topics. If you are new to OpenSG you might want
to follow these examples in order, or perhaps better yet, check out the
contents of Examples/Tutorial (and the README there) where the code is
accompanied by an introductory text on the online wiki.
The un-numbered programs each demonstrate a specific feature and have generally
no specific order in which they should be studied.

A number of the examples can load models from disc by passing a file name as
argument on the command line. If you don't have a suitable model, you can find
some in Examples/Tutorial/Data (look for .wrl files).

For questions, ideas or contributions you can contact the opensg-users mailing
list opensg-users@lists.sourceforge.net.
