Creating a new container type.


We will create a new type of NodeCore that can render cubes. The example will
place the new container type in a separate shared library (CubesLib) and a short
glut-based program will demonstrate the how to use the new type (CubesApp).


Steps taken:

* write OSGCubes.fcd
  We name our new container type simply "Cubes" and derive it from
  "MaterialDrawable". Since the type itself is not part of OpenSG (it will live
  in a separate shared library) we set systemcomponent to "false", but
  parentsystemcomponent to "true" (MaterialDrawable belongs to OpenSG).

  Since we know that the container will render cubes, we only specify a position
  and size (length, i.e. the length of an edge of the cube) as well as a color.
  All three fields are "multi" fields, because we want our type to render many
  cubes not just one.

* generate the source files
  Run fcd2code and generate the Base and User files (options -b and -f).

* edit User files
  Add drawPrimitives() member function. All (non-abstract) types derived from
  MaterialDrawable must define this function. This is the function that gets
  called to render the drawable. Here we just use immediate mode to draw some
  cubes, a better implementation would use display lists or VBOs to speed things
  up.

  Add fill() member function. It is used to gather some statistics about the
  Drawable, so we fill in the number of vertices and triangles that are rendered
  for our cubes.

  Add adjustVolume() member function. This is used to make sure the frustum
  culling works correctly. The implementation is rather simple, it simply
  extends the volume to contain each corner of every cube.
  More efficient implemenations could cache that information an only update it
  if the member fields are modified.


* write a CMakeLists.txt file to compile the CubesLib library
  This step is somewhat optional, of course you don't have to use cmake to
  compile the library, but can use your preferred build system to get the job
  done.

 * TODO compiling CubesLib - (setting OPENSG_ROOT and BOOST_ROOT)

 * TODO writing CubesApp

 * TODO writing the CMakeLists.txt for CubesApp
