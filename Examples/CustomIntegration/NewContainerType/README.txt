Adding new container types to OpenSG
====================================

This example shows how to create a new container type for OpenSG. It comes in
two flavors: one that puts the container in a new shared library (CubesLib) and builds a
separate application executable (CubesApp) using the shared lib and the other
simply links all the sources into the application (CubesAppUnified).

The full documentation for this example is on the OpenSG wiki:
opensg.vrsource.org/trac/wiki/Tutorial/OpenSG2/NewContainerType

The page has a description of the necessary steps as well as instructions for
building the provided code.
If you have questions or would like to contribute improvements for the example
and its documenation please drop us a message on the opensg-users mailing list:
