OpenSG Tutorial
===============

The files in this directory are part of the OpenSG tutorial you can find on
the project's website (opensg.vrsource.org/trac/wiki/Tutorial).

To build the programs you need CMake which you can download from the
web (www.cmake.org, you need version 2.6 or later) - for linux there is
probably a package for your distribution available.
In order to find the OpenSG libraries and some dependencies you need to
tell cmake where to find them. Call cmake with the following options:

 cmake -DOPENSG_ROOT=<PATH_TO_OPENSG>  \
       -DBOOST_ROOT=<PATH_TO_BOOST>    \
       -DCOLLADA_ROOT_DIR=<PATH_TO_COLLADA>

If you use your system's boost, you don't need the BOOST_ROOT option, it
find it, just make sure that it is the same then that used to build
OpenSG, or you are likely to run into nasty runtime problems.
The COLLADA_ROOT_DIR option can be left out if your OpenSG was not built
with collada supprot otherwise it is required.

Although the tutorial programs are better commented than the OpenSG code base
in general ( ;) ) we still recommend that you follow the online tutorial as it
conains information on what aspect of the system is demonstrated and how these
relate to each other.
The online tutorial is part of our wiki, so if you find typos or would like to
improve the explanations there, you are welcome to edit the pages. For
questions, ideas or contributions you can contact the opensg-users mailing
list opensg-users@lists.sourceforge.net.

    Enjoy,
        The OpenSG Team
