OpenSG Tutorial
===============

The files in this directory are part of the OpenSG tutorial you can find on
the project's website (opensg.vrsource.org/trac/wiki/Tutorial).

To build the programs you need scons which you can download (www.scons.org) or
(if you have a complete OpenSG source tree) use the version
Tools/scons-local/scons.py.  In order to find the OpenSG libraries the
included SConstruct file looks for the osg2-config tool that is normally
installed with OpenSG. If osg2-config can not be found on your PATH, please
pass the OPENSG2CONFIGDIR=/dir/where/osg2-config/can/be/found command line
argument when invoking scons.

Although the tutorial programs are better commented than the OpenSG code base
in general ( ;) ) we still recommend that you follow the online tutorial as it
conains information on what aspect of the system is demonstrated and how these
relate to each other.
The online tutorial is part of our wiki, so if you find typos or would like to
improve the explanations there, you are welcome to edit the pages. For
questions, ideas or contributions you can contact the opensg-users mailing
list opensg-users@lists.sourceforge.net.

    Enjoy,
        The OpenSG Team
