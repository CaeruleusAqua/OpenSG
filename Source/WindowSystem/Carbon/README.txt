This directory contains an OpenSG window class that allows to integrate OpenSG into applications written using the native Mac OS UI API "Carbon". This is the C++ API - there also exists another Objective-C-based API called "Cocoa" which cannot be used in conjunction with this library.

There is also a small test program called "testWindowCarbon.cpp" that demonstrates how to use the OpenSG Carbon window class.
