This directory contains an OpenSG window class that allows to integrate OpenSG into applications written using the native Mac OS UI API "Cocoa". This is the Objective-C API - there also exists another C++-based API called "Carbon" which cannot be used in conjunction with this library.

There is also a small test program called "testWindowCocoa.cpp" that demonstrates how to use the OpenSG Cocoa window class.
