VisitSubTree provides a way to point the renderer to another section of the
scene graph for rendering. This is useful for multi-pass algorithms using
OSG::Stage because it provides a way to render the same graph multiple times
without duplicating the nodes.

        Reference to the sub-graph to draw in place of this node.
        Whatever node is pointed to will be drawn here as if it was duplicated
        at this location.
