/*
Welcome to OpenSG.

OpenSG is a scenegraph system for realtime rendering, e.g. for Virtual Reality
applications. It is just a library, not a full application.

This documentation contains descriptions of the internal classes and concepts,
as well as a tutorial that explains how to use the system.

The classes are easiest to find via the Class Hierarchy at the top of the
page. This is a pretty long list, so be warned...


\ext

This documentation contains information about extending the system, i.e.
what to do when adding new classes to the system to make sure they are
registered in all the right places and integrate themselves seamlessly.

\endext

\dev

It also contains additional information that explains the internals and
how things work inside the library itself, for those who really need to know.

\enddev

While we tried to make this documentation easy to understand and without
mistakes and errors, we're very interested in getting feedback on omissions,
improvement ideas or simply typos. Send them to dirk@users.sf.net.
