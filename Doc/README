Root directory for OpenSG documentation
=======================================

To generate the doxygen docs, go to your build directory (or create a new one [1]),
run cmake in it and then call make Doc (or build the Doc target from your IDE).
The documentation will be generated in the Doc subdirector of your *build* directory.
You can pass the following variables to cmake to control the
generated documentation:

OSG_DOXY_DOC_TYPE=User (Developer, Trac)
  Select the target audience for the documentation. The Developer setting
  will add details that are generally only of interest for extending
  OpenSG itself. The Trac setting is intended for integration of the
  documentation on the OpenSG Trac website, you probably don't want this mode [2].

OSG_DOXY_INPUTS=<FILE>
  Choose a file that contains the list of sources that doxygen scans.
  This is mainly useful when working on the documentation to reduce the
  size and build time of the docs.

OSG_DOXY_STDOUT_LOG=<FILE>
  Choose a file that will contain a log of the doxygen run.
  This is mainly useful when working on the documentation to be able to
  check for warnings reported by doxygen.


See http://opensg.vrsource.org/trac/wiki/Dev/CodingStandard for information
about how to add documentation to your favorite white spot on the OpenSG
documentation map.



[1] Please the the OpenSG wiki for instructions on how to do this:

[2] It uses some extensions that haven't been accepted for the doxygen main
    branch yet. You need to download the sources and apply the aliasdiff patch in
    this directory in doxygen/src to make it work. Without this the aliases to link
    into the Wiki won't work, the rest will be fine.
