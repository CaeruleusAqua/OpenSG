Root directory for OpenSG documentation
=======================================

To generate the standalone docs, run doxygen standalone.doxy. For the docs
that go on Trac use doxygen trac.doxy.

They both use some extensions that haven't been accepted for the doxygen main
branch yet. You need to download the sources and apply the aliasdiff patch in
this directory in doxygen/src to make it work. Without this the aliases to link
into the Wiki won't work, the rest will be fine.

See http://opensg.vrsource.org/trac/wiki/Dev/CodingStandard for information
about how to add documentation to your favorite white spot on the OpenSG
documentation map.
